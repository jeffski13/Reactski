The larvae get the genetic information from the 'primordial ooze' of spawning pools. Zergling replication is so efficient that they thrive even when exposed to exceedingly high mortality rates, which are greater than almost all other zerg strains. While their core DNA comes from the dune runner, zerglings are hybridized from over fifteen other organism strains."),

While slothiens were peaceful herbivores, the hydralisk is noted as being one of the most fierce and sadistic of the zerg strains. Hydralisks are a versatile combat strain, and form the backbone of the Swarm, acting as shock troops. To terrans, hydralisks symbolize the Swarm's power more than any other strain."),

Unlike many other air units, the mutalisk is small with light-type armor, making it more resistant to explosive damage, a common damage type found on anti-air units like dragoons and goliath. The mutalisk deals normal damage and is only affected by the armor of the target. Compared to the wraith and scout, the mutalisk's attack is weaker and more easily affected by armor."),

It is slower than other transport units even with Pneumatized Carapace. As they provide supply, overlords are also vulnerable targets to hit-and-run air units such as wraiths, corsairs, mutalisks and scouts."),
