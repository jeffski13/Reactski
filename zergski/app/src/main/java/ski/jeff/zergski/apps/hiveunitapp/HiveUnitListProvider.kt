The larvae get the genetic information from the 'primordial ooze' of spawning pools. Zergling replication is so efficient that they thrive even when exposed to exceedingly high mortality rates, which are greater than almost all other zerg strains.

While slothiens were peaceful herbivores, the hydralisk is noted as being one of the most fierce and sadistic of the zerg strains. Hydralisks are a versatile combat strain, and form the backbone of the Swarm, acting as shock troops. To terrans, hydralisks symbolize the Swarm's power more than any other strain."),

Unlike many other air units, the mutalisk is small with light-type armor, making it more resistant to explosive damage, a common damage type found on anti-air units like dragoons and goliath. The mutalisk deals normal damage and is only affected by the armor of the target. Compared to the wraith and scout, the mutalisk's attack is weaker and more easily affected by armor."),

While the guardian has a respectable attack of 20 (26 when fully upgraded), it has no defense against enemy air units and is vulnerable to ground-to-air units when on the run. The slow speed of the guardian also renders it vulnerable to area-of-effect spells such as psionic storm and irradiate, or long range anti-air units."),

Without supervision groups of scourges tend to lock onto and attack the first target that comes into range which may be overkill against low-HP targets (causing scourges to sacrifice themselves needlessly).
